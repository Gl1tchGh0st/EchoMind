# EchoMind

My first AI-based project is an audio-based AI chatbot. It works by using several OpenAI APIs, including Whisper, ChatGPT, and TTS, and sending data through each. The final result is a ChatGPT response in audio format.

Functionality is still somewhat limited, and the program is quite slow. It is also heavily reliant on the OpenAI API platform, where some could be substituted in the future for local, offline processing, such as starting with Whisper. Additionally, I aim to add features that parse for keywords which execute specific commands, such as "Weather", to fetch the local weather data.

This project is still in the early stages of development and needs many more hours before it reaches the level of quality necessary for daily use.
